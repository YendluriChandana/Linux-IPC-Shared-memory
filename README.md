# Ex06-Linux IPC-Shared-memory

# AIM:
To Write a C program that illustrates two processes communicating using shared memory.

# DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Navigate to any Linux environment installed on the system or installed inside a virtual environment like virtual box/vmware or online linux JSLinux (https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192) or docker.

### Step 2:

Write the C Program using Linux Process API - Shared Memory

### Step 3:

Execute the C Program for the desired output. 

# PROGRAM:

## Write a C program that illustrates two processes communicating using shared memory.
